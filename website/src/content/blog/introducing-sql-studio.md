## Why We Built SQL Studio

As developers, we've always been frustrated with database management tools that feel stuck in the past. Switching between multiple tools, struggling with collaboration, and wrestling with complex queries - these were our daily challenges.

SQL Studio was born from a simple mission: **Make database work feel effortless and collaborative**.

## Key Features That Set Us Apart

### 1. Real-Time Team Collaboration
Imagine working on a database query with your team, seeing changes in real-time, just like Google Docs for your data. No more endless email threads or confusion about the latest version.

### 2. AI-Powered Query Assistance
Our intelligent assistant helps you write better queries faster. Need to join three complex tables? Just describe what you want, and our AI will generate the optimized SQL for you.

### 3. Multi-Database Support
PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite - we've got you covered. One tool, endless possibilities.

## Our Vision

We're not just building a tool. We're creating a new way of working with data - faster, smarter, and more collaborative.
