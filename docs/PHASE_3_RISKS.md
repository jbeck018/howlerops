## Critical Risks (Requires Immediate Attention)

### RISK-001: Permission System Complexity Leads to Security Vulnerabilities

**Category:** Technical / Security
**Probability:** Medium (40%)
**Impact:** Critical
**Priority:** Critical
**Status:** Active

**Description:**
RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) implementation is complex with many edge cases. Bugs in permission checks could allow unauthorized access to data, exposing organizations to security breaches.

**Indicators:**
- Permission check logic becomes convoluted
- Tests don't cover all permission combinations
- Security audit finds privilege escalation vulnerabilities
- Users report accessing data they shouldn't see

**Impact if Occurs:**
- Data breach / unauthorized data access
- Loss of customer trust
- Legal/compliance issues (GDPR violations)
- Emergency security patches required
- Potential halt of Phase 3 launch

**Root Causes:**
- Three roles (owner, admin, member) with overlapping permissions
- Shared resources have multiple ownership scenarios
- Frontend and backend permission checks must stay in sync
- Edge cases (ownership transfer, member removal during edit)

**Mitigation Strategies:**

**Prevention:**
1. Start with minimal permission model (3 roles only)
2. Create comprehensive permission matrix document
3. Write tests before implementation (TDD approach)
4. Security review at Week 15 (before full implementation)
5. Use permission middleware consistently on all endpoints
6. Single source of truth for permission logic

**Detection:**
1. Automated permission test suite (>200 test cases)
2. External security audit in Week 16
3. Penetration testing by security engineer
4. Code review for all permission-related changes
5. Monitoring for 403 errors spike (unauthorized access attempts)

**Response Plan if Occurs:**
1. **Immediate:** Halt deployment, audit all permission checks
2. **Short-term:** Fix vulnerabilities, deploy hotfix
3. **Medium-term:** Enhanced testing, additional security review
4. **Long-term:** Consider using battle-tested RBAC library

**Contingency:**
- Defer advanced permissions to Phase 4
- Simplify to 2 roles (admin, member) if needed
- Add pessimistic locking for sensitive operations
- Implement audit logging for all permission checks

**Responsible:** Backend Engineer, Security Engineer
**Review Date:** Weekly during Sprint 3 (Weeks 15-16)

### RISK-002: Multi-User Concurrent Editing Causes Data Loss

**Category:** Technical / Data Integrity
**Probability:** High (60%)
**Impact:** High
**Priority:** Critical
**Status:** Active

**Description:**
Multiple users editing the same shared resource simultaneously can lead to data conflicts, overwrites, and potential data loss if conflict resolution is not robust.

**Indicators:**
- Users report lost edits
- Conflict resolution dialog shows incorrect data
- Sync errors increase
- Last-write-wins overwrites important changes

**Impact if Occurs:**
- User data loss (very bad UX)
- Loss of user trust
- Support ticket volume increase
- Negative reviews
- Need for data recovery tools

**Root Causes:**
- Optimistic locking allows concurrent edits
- Network latency causes out-of-order updates
- Last-write-wins strategy too aggressive
- Insufficient conflict detection
- Users not notified of concurrent edits

**Mitigation Strategies:**

**Prevention:**
1. Implement optimistic locking with version numbers
2. Add "currently editing" indicators in UI
3. Show last modified time and user
4. Warn before overwriting recent changes
5. Implement conflict resolution UI (not just auto-resolve)
6. Add real-time presence indicators (optional)

**Detection:**
1. Comprehensive multi-user tests (2+ users editing same resource)
2. Monitor conflict rate metrics
3. User feedback during beta testing
4. Automated conflict detection tests
5. Data integrity validation queries

**Response Plan if Occurs:**
1. **Immediate:** Document reproduction steps, notify team
2. **Short-term:** Fix conflict resolution logic
3. **Medium-term:** Enhance UI warnings, improve UX
4. **Long-term:** Consider operational transform or CRDTs

**Contingency:**
- Implement pessimistic locking for critical resources
- Add "force save" option with explicit warning
- Keep conflict history for manual recovery
- Add "undo" functionality

**Responsible:** Backend Engineer, Frontend Engineer
**Review Date:** Daily during Sprint 4 (Week 17)
