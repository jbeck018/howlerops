## Architecture

HowlerOps uses a modern desktop-first architecture designed for performance and extensibility:

- **Desktop Framework**: Wails v2 for cross-platform native desktop application
- **Backend**: Go with Wails runtime bindings for direct frontend-backend communication
- **Frontend**: React 19 with TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS
- **Storage**: Encrypted SQLite for connection management
- **Communication**: WebSocket for real-time features, Wails runtime for IPC
- **AI**: Pluggable architecture supporting multiple providers with native integration
