/*
SHARED RESOURCES FEATURE DOCUMENTATION:

Visibility Modes:
- personal: Only visible to the owner
- shared: Visible to all members of the organization

Access Control:
- Only the owner can change visibility from personal to shared
- Only the owner can unshare (change from shared to personal)
- Organization members can view and use shared resources
- Permission checks are enforced at the service layer

Sync Behavior:
- Personal resources sync only for the owner
- Shared resources sync for all organization members
- Conflicts are resolved using last-write-wins strategy
- Metadata tracks who shared the resource and when

Views:
- v_user_accessible_connections: All connections a user can access
- v_user_accessible_queries: All queries a user can access
- Both views include personal + shared from user's orgs

Audit Trail:
- shared_by: User ID who made the resource shared
- shared_at: Timestamp when the resource was shared
- Audit logs track all sharing/unsharing actions

Migration Notes:
- All existing resources default to 'personal' visibility
- No existing data is modified during migration
- Triggers ensure data integrity for visibility changes
