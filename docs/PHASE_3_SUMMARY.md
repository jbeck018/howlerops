# Phase 3: Team Collaboration - Architecture Summary

## Overview

Complete production-ready architecture for Phase 3 Team Collaboration features has been designed and documented. This adds organization/team capabilities to SQL Studio while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing Individual tier users.

---

## What's Been Delivered

### 1. PHASE_3_ARCHITECTURE.md (Main Architecture)
**Location:** `/Users/jacob_1/projects/sql-studio/backend-go/PHASE_3_ARCHITECTURE.md`

**Contents:**
- Complete REST API specification
- All endpoints with request/response examples
- Error responses for every scenario
- Rate limits and headers
- Data models (TypeScript interfaces)
- OpenAPI 3.0 reference

**Endpoints Covered:**
- **Organizations:** Create, list, get, update, delete (5 endpoints)
- **Members:** Invite, list, update role, remove, leave (5 endpoints)
- **Shared Resources:** Share/unshare connections & queries, list, update permissions (8 endpoints)

**Key Concepts:**
- Dual context (personal + organization resources)
- Shared resources downloaded separately
- Permission-based filtering
- Enhanced conflict resolution (owner wins, permission-based, etc.)
- Backward compatible (Phase 2 sync continues unchanged)

---

## Architecture Highlights

### Database Design

**PostgreSQL (Auth + Organizations):**
```
- organizations (team/org details)
- organization_members (RBAC, invitations)
- shared_connections (connection sharing)
- shared_queries (query sharing)
- audit_logs (compliance & security)
```

**Turso (Sync Data):**
```
- connection_templates (extended with organization_id)
- saved_queries (extended with organization_id)
- query_history (extended with organization_id)
- organization_sync_metadata (sync tracking)
- shared_resource_access (analytics)
```

### Permission Model (RBAC)

| Role | Can Do |
|------|--------|
| **Owner** | Everything (org settings, delete org, manage all members) |
| **Admin** | Invite/manage members, share resources, view audit logs |
| **Member** | Share own resources, use shared resources, view members |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access to shared resources |

### Resource Permissions

| Permission | Allows |
|------------|--------|
| **read** | View resource details |
| **execute** | Run queries, use connections |
| **modify** | Edit resource settings |
| **delete** | Delete the resource |

---

## API Design Pattern

All endpoints follow consistent patterns:

```http
# Organization context
/api/organizations/:id

# Member management
/api/organizations/:id/members
/api/organizations/:id/invite

# Resource sharing
/api/organizations/:id/connections/:conn_id/share
/api/organizations/:id/queries/:query_id/share

# Audit
/api/organizations/:id/audit
```

**Authorization:**
- All endpoints require JWT Bearer token
- All operations check organization membership
- Role-based access control enforced
- Resource-level permissions checked

---

## Sync Protocol Changes

### Before (Phase 2):
```typescript
// Upload personal resources
POST /api/sync/upload
{
  "device_id": "device_123",
  "changes": [...]
}
```

### After (Phase 3):
```typescript
// Upload personal resources (unchanged)
POST /api/sync/upload
{
  "device_id": "device_123",
  "changes": [...] // organization_id = null
}

// Upload organization resources (NEW)
POST /api/sync/upload
{
  "device_id": "device_123",
  "organization_id": "org_team123",
  "changes": [...] // organization_id = "org_team123"
}

// Download includes shared resources
GET /api/sync/download?organization_id=org_team123&include_shared=true
{
  "connections": [...owned...],
  "saved_queries": [...owned...],
  "shared_resources": {
    "connections": [...shared by others...],
    "queries": [...shared by others...]
  }
}
```

---

## Security Model

### Multi-Layer Security

1. **Authentication:** JWT tokens with organization context
2. **Authorization:** RBAC + resource-level permissions
3. **Audit Logging:** All operations logged (WHO, WHAT, WHEN, WHERE)
4. **Rate Limiting:** Per-organization limits
5. **Data Isolation:** All queries scoped by organization_id
6. **Credential Protection:** Passwords never synced or returned in API

### Example Authorization Check

```go
// Every operation checks:
1. Is user authenticated? (JWT valid)
2. Is user a member of this organization?
3. Does user have required role? (owner, admin, member, viewer)
4. Does user have resource permission? (read, execute, modify, delete)
```

---

## Migration Strategy

### For Existing Users

**Automatic Migration:**
1. Backend creates "personal" organization for each user
2. User is set as owner of personal org
3. All existing resources remain personal (organization_id = NULL)
4. Sync continues to work exactly as before

**Zero Disruption:**
- No UI changes required for Individual tier
- Phase 2 sync endpoints continue to work
- Users can opt-in to team features later

### Database Migration

```sql
-- Step 1: Create Phase 3 tables
CREATE TABLE organizations (...);
CREATE TABLE organization_members (...);
-- etc.

-- Step 2: Migrate existing users
INSERT INTO organizations (id, name, owner_id, plan)
SELECT 'org_personal_' || id, username, id, 'individual'
FROM users;

-- Step 3: Add users as owners of personal orgs
INSERT INTO organization_members (organization_id, user_id, role)
SELECT 'org_personal_' || id, id, 'owner'
FROM users;
```

---

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Included

1. **Indexes:** All critical queries indexed
   - Membership checks: `(user_id, organization_id)`
   - Shared resources: `(organization_id, unshared_at)`
   - Audit logs: `(organization_id, timestamp DESC)`

2. **Caching:** Redis-based caching
   - Membership checks (5 min TTL)
   - Organization details (15 min TTL)
   - Permission checks (5 min TTL)

3. **Batch Operations:** Avoid N+1 queries
   - Load orgs with members in single JOIN
   - Batch permission checks

4. **Pagination:** All list endpoints paginated
   - Audit logs: max 100 per page
   - Members: default 50 per page

5. **Connection Pooling:**
   - Separate pools for read/write operations
   - Read pool: 50 connections
   - Write pool: 20 connections

## Next Steps

1. **Review Documentation**
   - Read through all three documents
   - Discuss with team
   - Identify any gaps or questions

2. **Prioritize Features**
   - Decide which features are MVP
   - Which can be deferred to Phase 3.1, 3.2, etc.

3. **Create Implementation Tasks**
   - Break down into Jira/Linear tickets
   - Assign to engineers
   - Set milestones

4. **Prototype Critical Paths**
   - Build proof-of-concept for:
     - Organization-scoped sync
     - Permission checks in handlers
     - Shared resource sync

5. **Set Up Infrastructure**
   - PostgreSQL database (production)
   - Redis for caching
   - Email service (Resend) for invitations
   - Monitoring (DataDog, Sentry)

6. **Begin Implementation**
   - Start with database migrations
   - Then core organization services
   - Then sharing features
   - Finally audit and security

## Questions to Answer

Before starting implementation:

1. **Billing:** How will team plans be priced? (Per member? Flat fee?)
2. **Limits:** What limits for free vs paid teams?
   - Max members: 5 free, 50 paid, unlimited enterprise?
   - Max shared resources?
   - Max API requests?
3. **Email Provider:** Use Resend for invitations? (Already in Phase 2)
4. **Real-Time:** Do we need WebSocket support in Phase 3.0 or defer to 3.1?
5. **Audit Retention:** How long to keep audit logs? (90 days? 1 year?)
6. **Export Format:** Do we need audit log export in 3.0 or defer?

---

## Success Metrics

Track these after Phase 3 launch:

- **Adoption:**
  - % of users who create a team organization
  - Average team size
  - % of connections/queries shared

- **Engagement:**
  - Shared resource usage (executions per shared resource)
  - Invitation acceptance rate
  - Active team members per org

- **Performance:**
  - Sync latency (p50, p95, p99)
  - API response times
  - Database query performance

- **Security:**
  - Audit log coverage (% of operations logged)
  - Permission check failures (should be low)
  - Unauthorized access attempts
