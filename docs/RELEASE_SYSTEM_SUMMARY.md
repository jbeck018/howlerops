- Cross-platform binary distribution

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. Updated Files

#### `/Users/jacob_1/projects/sql-studio/backend-go/Makefile`
**Changes:**
- Added VERSION, GIT_COMMIT, BUILD_DATE variables
- Added LDFLAGS for embedding version info at build time
- Created platform-specific release targets:
  - `release-darwin-amd64` - macOS Intel
  - `release-darwin-arm64` - macOS Apple Silicon
  - `release-linux-amd64` - Linux AMD64
  - `release-linux-arm64` - Linux ARM64

## Build System Features

### Version Management

The version system uses three variables:
- `VERSION` - Semantic version (e.g., 2.1.0)
- `GIT_COMMIT` - Short git commit hash
- `BUILD_DATE` - ISO 8601 timestamp

These are embedded into the binary using Go's ldflags:
```bash
-ldflags="-X main.Version=$(VERSION) -X main.Commit=$(GIT_COMMIT) -X main.BuildDate=$(BUILD_DATE)"
```

### Multi-Platform Builds

The release system supports:
- **macOS**: Intel (amd64) and Apple Silicon (arm64)
- **Linux**: AMD64 and ARM64
- **Windows**: AMD64

All builds use CGO_ENABLED=1 to support SQLite native bindings.

### Release Archives

The `release-all` target automatically:
1. Builds binaries for all platforms
2. Creates `.tar.gz` archives for Unix platforms
3. Creates `.zip` archive for Windows
4. Generates SHA256 checksums for all archives
5. Provides next steps for publishing

### Checksum Verification

All releases include a `checksums.txt` file with SHA256 hashes for verification:
```bash
shasum -a 256 -c checksums.txt --ignore-missing
```

## Release Workflow

### Automated Process

1. **Developer creates release:**
   ```bash
   make release-all VERSION=2.1.0
   git tag -a v2.1.0 -m "Release v2.1.0"
   git push origin v2.1.0
   ```

2. **GitHub Actions automatically:**
   - Detects the new tag
   - Builds binaries for all platforms
   - Runs full test suite
   - Creates release archives
   - Generates checksums
   - Creates GitHub Release with all artifacts
   - Deploys to Cloud Run (production)
   - Runs smoke tests

3. **Users install via:**
   - Quick install script
   - Direct download from GitHub Releases
   - Homebrew (coming soon)
   - Docker Hub

### Manual Steps (Optional)

- Update documentation sites
- Announce on social media
- Update Homebrew formula (when available)
- Email newsletter (for major releases)

## Documentation Structure

### User-Facing Docs

- **README.md** - Project overview, quick start
- **INSTALL.md** - Detailed installation guide
- **RELEASE_TEMPLATE.md** - Release notes template

### Developer-Facing Docs

- **RELEASE.md** - Release process guide
- **Makefile** - Build automation
- **backend-go/DEPLOYMENT.md** - Production deployment

## Key Benefits

1. **Automated**: Minimal manual steps required
2. **Reproducible**: Consistent builds via Makefile
3. **Verified**: Checksums for all artifacts
4. **Multi-platform**: Support for all major OS/architecture combinations
5. **Versioned**: Clear version tracking in binaries
6. **Documented**: Comprehensive guides for all processes

## Testing the System

### Build a Release

```bash
cd backend-go

# Test version variables
make release
./build/sql-studio-backend --version

# Test full release
make release-all VERSION=2.0.1

# Verify artifacts
ls -lh build/
cat build/checksums.txt
```

### Verify Version Info

```bash
# Check version is embedded
./build/sql-studio-backend --version

# Should output:
# SQL Studio Backend
# Version:    2.0.1
# Commit:     <current git hash>
# Build Date: <current timestamp>
```

### Test Archive Checksums

```bash
cd build
shasum -a 256 -c checksums.txt
# All files should show "OK"
```

## Next Steps

1. **Create First Release:**
   ```bash
   cd backend-go
   make release-all VERSION=2.0.0
   git tag -a v2.0.0 -m "Release v2.0.0 - Production ready"
   git push origin v2.0.0
   ```

2. **Set Up GitHub Secrets:**
   - Ensure all required secrets are configured in GitHub Settings
   - Required: GCP_PROJECT_ID, GCP_SA_KEY, TURSO_URL, TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN, JWT_SECRET

3. **Test Installation:**
   - Download release from GitHub
   - Test on different platforms
   - Verify checksums

4. **Create Homebrew Tap (Future):**
   - Set up homebrew-sqlstudio repository
   - Create formula
   - Submit to homebrew/core

## Relevant Code Snippets

### Version Variables in main.go

```go
// Version information (set via ldflags during build)
var (
    Version   = "dev"
    Commit    = "unknown"
    BuildDate = "unknown"
)

func main() {
    // Handle version flag
    if len(os.Args) > 1 && (os.Args[1] == "--version" || os.Args[1] == "-v") {
        fmt.Printf("SQL Studio Backend\n")
        fmt.Printf("Version:    %s\n", Version)
        fmt.Printf("Commit:     %s\n", Commit)
        fmt.Printf("Build Date: %s\n", BuildDate)
        os.Exit(0)
    }
    // ... rest of main
}
```

### Makefile Version Variables

```makefile
VERSION ?= 2.0.0
GIT_COMMIT := $(shell git rev-parse --short HEAD)
BUILD_DATE := $(shell date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
LDFLAGS := -ldflags="-X main.Version=$(VERSION) -X main.Commit=$(GIT_COMMIT) -X main.BuildDate=$(BUILD_DATE) -w -s"
```

### Release Build Command

```makefile
release-all: clean release-darwin-amd64 release-darwin-arm64 release-linux-amd64 release-linux-arm64 release-windows-amd64
    @echo "Building release archives for version $(VERSION)..."
    # Create archives for each platform
    # Generate checksums
    # Show next steps
```

## Success Criteria

- [x] Makefile updated with version variables and release targets
- [x] main.go updated with version flag support
- [x] RELEASE.md created with comprehensive process documentation
- [x] INSTALL.md created with multi-platform installation guides
- [x] README.md updated with installation section and badges
- [x] .github/RELEASE_TEMPLATE.md created for release notes
- [x] All builds produce versioned binaries
- [x] Checksums are generated for verification
- [x] Documentation is clear and actionable

## Conclusion

SQL Studio now has a production-ready release system with:
- Automated builds for all platforms
- Clear versioning and tracking
- Comprehensive documentation
