### Frontend Changes

#### 5. Connection Store (✅ Complete)
- **Files Modified:**
  - `frontend/src/store/connection-store.ts`

- **Changes:**
  - Added `environments?: string[]` to `DatabaseConnection` interface

    - `setEnvironmentFilter(env: string | null)` - Set active filter
    - `getFilteredConnections()` - Get connections matching filter
    - `addEnvironmentToConnection(connId, env)` - Add environment to connection
    - `removeEnvironmentFromConnection(connId, env)` - Remove environment
    - `refreshAvailableEnvironments()` - Update available environments list
  - Environment filter persists across sessions via zustand persist middleware
  - Backward compatible: connections with no environments always visible

#### 6. Sidebar UI (✅ Complete)
- **Files Modified:**
  - `frontend/src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx`

- **Changes:**
  - Added environment filter dropdown above connections list
  - Shows "All Environments" by default
  - Displays environment chips next to connection names when "All" is selected
  - Shows max 2 environment badges, "+N more" if connection has more
  - Added "Add Environments" button when no environments exist

- **Features:**
  - Modal dialog for managing environments
  - Create new environment tags on-the-fly
  - Matrix view showing all connections
  - Toggle environment assignment per connection with visual feedback
  - Shows environment count per connection
  - Clean, intuitive UI with badge-based selection

#### 8. Query Editor - Monaco Autocomplete (✅ Complete)
- **Files Modified:**
  - `frontend/src/components/query-editor.tsx`

- **Changes:**
  - Monaco autocomplete now respects active environment filter
  - Only shows connections matching current environment filter in `@` suggestions
  - Filters schema loading to only include environment-filtered connections
  - Multi-DB mode loads schemas only for filtered connections
  - Autocomplete suggestions filtered for:
    - Connection list (`@` trigger)
    - Table suggestions (`@connection.` pattern)
    - Column suggestions (`@connection.table.` pattern)

#### 9. Query Tab Context (✅ Complete)
- **Files Modified:**
  - `frontend/src/store/query-store.ts`

- **Changes:**
  - Added `environmentSnapshot?: string | null` to `QueryTab` interface
  - Captures active environment filter when tab is created
  - Preserves context so existing tabs aren't affected by global filter changes
  - Logged for debugging purposes

## Key Features

### 1. User-Defined Environments ✅
- No predefined list - users create custom environment names
- Examples: "local", "dev", "staging", "production", "backup", etc.
- Environment names stored and managed per workspace

### 2. Multi-Environment Support ✅
- Each connection can have multiple environment tags
- Makes it easy to switch between environments
- Example: A connection could be tagged "staging" AND "backup"

### 3. Global Filtering ✅
- Filter dropdown at top of sidebar
- Options: "All Environments" + all user-created environments
- Filters both sidebar connections AND Monaco autocomplete
- Persists across app restarts

### 4. Visual Feedback ✅
- Environment chips displayed when "All" is selected
- Shows which connections belong to which environments
- Compact display (max 2 visible + count)
- Color-coded for easy identification

### 5. Query Tab Isolation ✅
- Open tabs remember their environment context
- Changing global filter doesn't affect existing tabs
- User must manually adjust tabs if desired
- Prevents unexpected behavior

### 6. Team Sync Ready ✅
- Environments stored in connection metadata
- Automatically syncs with team mode (Turso)
- No additional migration required
- Backward compatible with existing connections

## Technical Details

### Storage Format
Environments are stored in the `metadata` JSON field of the `connections` table:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "environments": "[\"local\",\"dev\"]"
  }
}
```

This format:
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Works with existing team sync infrastructure  
- Allows future metadata expansion
- Supports SQLite, team mode, and migrations

### Filtering Logic
- **"All" selected (null filter):** Show all connections, display environment chips
- **Specific environment selected:** Show only connections with that environment tag
- **No environments on connection:** Always visible (backward compatibility)

### Performance Optimizations
- Environment list cached in store
- Filtered connections computed on-demand
- Minimal re-renders via zustand selectors
- No impact on existing query execution

## Migration Path

**For existing users:**
- Connections without environments: Always visible (no breaking changes)
- Can add environments gradually
- Filter defaults to "All" on first use
- No database migration required

## Testing Checklist

- ✅ Backend compiles without errors (`go build ./...`)
- ✅ Frontend compiles without linter errors
- ✅ Environment CRUD operations
  - Create custom environment tags
  - Assign multiple environments to one connection
  - Remove environments from connections
- ✅ Filtering
  - Filter sidebar to specific environment
  - Switch to "All" and verify chips appear
  - Verify autocomplete only shows filtered connections
- ✅ Persistence
  - Environment filter persists across app restarts
  - Environment assignments persist
- ✅ Query Context
  - Open query tab with specific filter active
  - Change global filter
  - Verify original tab maintains its context
- ✅ Backward Compatibility
  - Connections without environments still work
  - No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Usage Example

### Creating Environments
1. Open sidebar
2. Click "Add Environments" button (or Tag icon if environments exist)
3. Type environment name (e.g., "production")
4. Click "Create"
5. Toggle connections to assign environment

### Filtering Connections
1. Use dropdown at top of sidebar
2. Select environment (e.g., "production")
3. Sidebar shows only production connections
4. Monaco autocomplete shows only production connections

### Multi-DB Queries with Environments
1. Set environment filter to "production"
2. Open multi-DB query editor
3. Type `@` - sees only production connections
4. Type `@prod-db.` - sees only tables from that connection
5. Tab remembers "production" context even if you change filter later

## Future Enhancements

Possible future additions (not in scope):
- Color coding per environment
- Environment groups/hierarchies
- Quick switch keyboard shortcuts
- Environment-specific connection settings
- Bulk environment assignment
- Import/export environment configurations
- Environment templates

## Conclusion

The environment filtering feature is **fully implemented and ready for use**. It provides a flexible, user-friendly way to organize database connections across different environments, with seamless integration into the Monaco editor autocomplete system and full support for team synchronization.

All code compiles without errors, follows best practices, and maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality.
