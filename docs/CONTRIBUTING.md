3. Provide use cases and examples
4. Consider implementation complexity

### Contributing Code

#### Setup Development Environment

```bash
# Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sql-studio.git
cd sql-studio

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Install dependencies
make deps

# Run tests to ensure everything works
make test
```

#### Development Workflow

1. **Make Changes**
   - Follow existing code style
   - Write meaningful commit messages
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

2. **Test Your Changes**
   ```bash
   # Run unit tests
   make test
   
   # Run linting
   make lint
   
   # Run full validation
   make validate
   ```

3. **CRITICAL: Complete Validation Checklist**
   Before submitting any changes, ensure ALL validation steps pass:
   
   **Frontend Validation:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run typecheck    # TypeScript type checking
   npm run lint         # ESLint validation
   npm run test:run     # Unit tests
   ```
   
   **Backend Validation:**
   ```bash
   go mod tidy          # Clean up Go modules
   go fmt ./...         # Format Go code
   go test ./...        # Run Go tests
   ```
   
   **Full Validation:**
   ```bash
   make validate        # Runs lint + test for both frontend and backend
   ```
   
   **Task completion checklist:**
   - [ ] All TypeScript types are valid (`npm run typecheck`)
   - [ ] Frontend code passes linting (`npm run lint`)
   - [ ] Frontend tests pass (`npm run test:run`)
   - [ ] Go modules are tidy (`go mod tidy`)
   - [ ] Go code is formatted (`go fmt ./...`)
   - [ ] Go tests pass (`go test ./...`)
   - [ ] Full validation passes (`make validate`)
   - [ ] Code compiles successfully (`make build`)

4. **Submit Pull Request**
   - Fill out the PR template completely
   - Reference related issues
   - Ensure CI passes
   - Request review from maintainers

### Code Style Guidelines

#### Go Code
- Follow standard Go conventions
- Use `gofmt` and `golint`
- Write descriptive variable names
- Add comments for exported functions
- Keep functions focused and small

#### TypeScript/React Code
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow React hooks best practices
- Use functional components
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Write unit tests with Jest

### Testing Requirements
