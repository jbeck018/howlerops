---

#### 1.3 Phase 3 Vision & Goals (10 min)
**Presenter:** Product Manager

**The Big Picture:**

SQL Studio currently serves individual users brilliantly. Phase 3 transforms it into a collaborative platform where teams can work together seamlessly.

**User Stories:**

*"As a database admin, I want to share connection configs with my team so they don't have to ask me for credentials every time."*

*"As a team lead, I want to invite team members and control who can edit our shared queries."*

*"As a DevOps engineer, I want to see an audit trail of who ran what queries on production."*

**Phase 3 Goals:**

1. **Enable Team Formation**
   - Organizations can be created
   - Members can be invited and managed
   - Clear roles and permissions

2. **Implement RBAC**
   - Three roles: Owner, Admin, Member
   - Permissions enforced on backend
   - UI respects permissions

3. **Enable Sharing**
   - Shared database connections
   - Shared saved queries
   - Multi-user collaboration without conflicts

4. **Ensure Compliance**
   - Audit logs for all sensitive actions
   - Who did what, when
   - Exportable for compliance

**Success Metrics:**
- 50+ teams created in first month
- <5% support tickets per user
- 70%+ invitation acceptance rate
- 95%+ user satisfaction with team features

---

#### 1.4 Scope & Timeline (10 min)
**Presenter:** Engineering Lead

**Timeline:** 6 weeks (Jan 16 - Feb 27, 2026)

**Sprint Breakdown:**

| Sprint | Week | Focus | Deliverable |
|--------|------|-------|-------------|
| Sprint 1 | 13 | Foundation | Orgs can be created |
| Sprint 2 | 14 | Invitations | Members can be invited |
| Sprint 3 | 15-16 | RBAC | Permissions enforced |
| Sprint 4 | 17 | Sharing | Resources shared |
| Sprint 5 | 18 | Polish | Production ready |

**Must-Have Features (Blocking Launch):**
- Organizations CRUD
- Member invitations with email
- Three roles (Owner, Admin, Member)
- Shared connections and queries
- Audit logging
- Permission enforcement

**Should-Have Features (Launch with notes):**
- Real-time "currently editing" indicators
- Bulk member invitation
- Organization transfer ownership
- Advanced audit log filtering

**Won't-Have This Phase (Defer to Phase 4):**
- Custom roles beyond 3 defaults
- Team activity feeds
- @mention notifications
- Query execution history sharing

**Question:** Any concerns about scope or timeline?

---

### Part 2: Technical Architecture (40 minutes)

#### 2.1 Database Schema Review (10 min)
**Presenter:** Backend Engineer

**New Tables:**

```sql
-- Core tables
organizations
organization_members
organization_invitations
audit_logs

-- Schema changes
ALTER TABLE connections ADD COLUMN organization_id TEXT;
ALTER TABLE connections ADD COLUMN visibility TEXT;
ALTER TABLE saved_queries ADD COLUMN organization_id TEXT;
ALTER TABLE saved_queries ADD COLUMN visibility TEXT;
```

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Soft deletes for organizations (deleted_at)
- Unique constraints on (organization_id, user_id) for members
- Token-based invitations with expiration
- Audit logs immutable (no updates/deletes)

**Migration Strategy:**
- Backward compatible (existing data unaffected)
- Migrations run before deployment
- Rollback scripts prepared

**Question Time:** Database schema concerns?

---

#### 2.2 API Endpoints Overview (10 min)
**Presenter:** Backend Engineer

**Organization Management:**
```
POST   /api/organizations
GET    /api/organizations
GET    /api/organizations/:id
PUT    /api/organizations/:id
DELETE /api/organizations/:id
```

**Member Management:**
```
GET    /api/organizations/:id/members
PUT    /api/organizations/:id/members/:userId
DELETE /api/organizations/:id/members/:userId
```

**Invitations:**
```
POST   /api/organizations/:id/invitations
GET    /api/invitations
POST   /api/invitations/:id/accept
POST   /api/invitations/:id/decline
DELETE /api/organizations/:id/invitations/:id
```

**Shared Resources:**
```
GET    /api/organizations/:id/connections
POST   /api/organizations/:id/connections
GET    /api/organizations/:id/queries
POST   /api/organizations/:id/queries
```

**Audit:**
```
GET    /api/organizations/:id/audit-logs
```

**Authentication:**
- All endpoints require JWT token
- Permission checks on every request
- Rate limiting for invitations

**Question Time:** API design concerns?

---

#### 2.3 Frontend Architecture (10 min)
**Presenter:** Frontend Engineer

**New UI Sections:**
- `/organizations` - Organization list
- `/organizations/:id` - Organization detail
- `/organizations/:id/members` - Member management
- `/organizations/:id/settings` - Org settings
- `/invitations` - Pending invitations list
- `/invite/:token` - Invitation acceptance page

**State Management:**

```typescript
// New stores
organization-store.ts
  - organizations: Organization[]
  - currentOrgId: string | null
  - actions: create, update, delete, switch

invitation-store.ts
  - invitations: Invitation[]
  - actions: invite, accept, decline

// Updated stores
connection-store.ts
  - Add organization context
  - Filter by personal/shared

query-store.ts
  - Add organization context
  - Filter by personal/shared
```

**New Components:**
- `<OrganizationList />` - Grid of orgs
- `<OrganizationCard />` - Single org card
- `<OrganizationSwitcher />` - Top nav dropdown
- `<MemberTable />` - Member list with roles
- `<InviteMemberModal />` - Invitation form
- `<InvitationBanner />` - Pending invitation notification
- `<SharedBadge />` - Indicator for shared resources
- `<PermissionGuard />` - Wrapper for permission-based rendering

**Question Time:** Frontend architecture concerns?

---

#### 2.4 Permission System Deep Dive (10 min)
**Presenter:** Security Engineer (first 30 min of meeting)

**Permission Matrix:**

| Action | Owner | Admin | Member |
|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| View org | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Edit org settings | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| Delete org | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Invite members | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| Remove members | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| View shared resources | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Create shared resources | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Edit shared resources | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (own only) |
| Delete shared resources | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (own only) |
| View audit logs | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |

**Backend Enforcement:**

```go
// Permission middleware
func RequireRole(role string) gin.HandlerFunc {
    return func(c *gin.Context) {
        userID := c.GetString("user_id")
        orgID := c.Param("orgId")

        member, err := getMember(orgID, userID)
        if err != nil || !hasRole(member, role) {
            c.JSON(403, gin.H{"error": "Forbidden"})
            c.Abort()
            return
        }

        c.Set("member", member)
        c.Next()
    }
}

// Usage
router.DELETE("/api/organizations/:orgId",
    AuthMiddleware(),
    RequireRole("owner"),
    deleteOrganization)
```

**Frontend Enforcement:**

```typescript
// Permission hook
const { canEdit, canDelete, canInvite } = usePermissions(orgId)

// Render based on permissions
{canInvite && <Button>Invite Members</Button>}
{canEdit && <Button>Edit Settings</Button>}
{canDelete && <Button>Delete Organization</Button>}
```

**Security Considerations:**
- Backend is source of truth (never trust frontend)
- Permission checks cached for 5 min (Redis)
- Audit all permission denials
- Rate limit failed permission checks

**Question Time:** Permission system concerns?

#### 5.2 Team Motivation & Closing (2 min)
**Presenter:** Product Manager / CTO

**Why Phase 3 Matters:**

We're building something special. SQL Studio started as a powerful individual tool, but Phase 3 transforms it into a platform where teams can collaborate. This is a game-changer for:

- Database teams who share connection configs
- Engineering teams who share query libraries
- DevOps teams who need audit trails
- Organizations who need proper RBAC

**Your Impact:**

Each of you plays a critical role:
- Backend team: You're building the foundation of trust and security
- Frontend team: You're creating the collaboration UX
- Design team: You're making complexity simple
- QA team: You're ensuring we ship quality

**Confidence:**

We've crushed Phase 1 and Phase 2 ahead of schedule. We have:
- ✓ Proven track record
- ✓ Solid foundation
- ✓ Clear plan
- ✓ Great team

Phase 3 will be no different. Let's build something amazing together!

**Final Words:**

- Trust the plan, but speak up if something's wrong
- Help each other (we're a team)
- Celebrate small wins
- Stay focused on the goal

**Let's do this! 🚀**
