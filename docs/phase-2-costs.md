## 7. Cost Optimization Strategies

### 7.1 Reduce Row Writes (Turso)

**Current Strategy:**
- Debounce tab content (2s): Saves 95% of writes
- Batch history (10 queries): Saves 90% of writes
- Incremental sync only: Saves 80% of bandwidth

**Impact:** $0.029/user → $0.005/user (83% reduction)

### 7.2 Email Optimization

**Strategy:**
- Transactional only (no marketing)
- Batch notifications
- Unsubscribe options

**Impact:** Stay on free tier longer (10K→50K users)

### 7.3 Backend Scaling

**Strategy:**
- Auto-scaling based on CPU/memory
- Horizontal scaling (add instances as needed)
- Cache aggressively (Redis layer if needed)

**Impact:** Scale to 10K users on 4 instances ($60/month)

### 7.4 Monitoring Optimization

**Strategy:**
- Sample error tracking (not 100%)
- Focus on critical errors
- Use free tier for non-prod

**Impact:** Stay on Team plan longer

## 10. Financial Risks & Mitigation

### Risk: Turso Cost Overrun

**Scenario:** Users average 10x expected writes
**Impact:** $29 → $290/month (still profitable)
**Mitigation:** Aggressive batching, longer debounce, retention policies

### Risk: Stripe Chargeback Rate

**Scenario:** 5% chargeback rate
**Impact:** -$45 revenue, +$15 fees per 100 users
**Mitigation:** Clear ToS, cancellation policy, proactive support

### Risk: Infrastructure Scaling

**Scenario:** 10K users faster than expected
**Impact:** $720/month vs $166/month budget
**Mitigation:** Revenue grows faster ($90K/month), easily covers

### Risk: Auth Provider Price Increase

**Scenario:** Supabase doubles price to $50/month
**Impact:** +$25/month (<0.3% margin impact)
**Mitigation:** Absorb cost or increase price by $0.50

## Appendix: Cost Calculator

### Formula for Monthly Cost at Scale

```
Total Monthly Cost =
  Auth ($25) +
  Database ($29) +
  Email (users > 10K ? $20 : $0) +
  Monitoring ($26) +
  Backend (ceil(users / 2500) * $15) +
  Frontend (users > 100K ? $20 : $0) +
  Stripe Fees (revenue * 0.031)

Cost Per User = Total Monthly Cost / Users

Profit = (Revenue - Total Monthly Cost - Dev Costs)
```

**Example:** 1,000 users at $9/month
```
Revenue = 1,000 * $9 = $9,000
Auth = $25
Database = $29
Email = $0
Monitoring = $26
Backend = ceil(1000 / 2500) * $15 = $15
Frontend = $0
Stripe = $9,000 * 0.031 = $279

Total Cost = $374
Profit = $9,000 - $374 = $8,626 (95.8% margin)
```

---

**Conclusion:** Phase 2 is financially viable with excellent margins. Break-even at 20 subscribers, profitable at scale, and sustainable long-term.
