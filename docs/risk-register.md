## Active Risks

### Phase 1: Foundation Risks

#### R1-001: IndexedDB Browser Compatibility Issues

**Category:** Technical
**Impact:** High
**Likelihood:** Medium
**Risk Score:** HIGH
**Status:** Open
**Owner:** Frontend Lead

**Description:**
IndexedDB implementation varies across browsers (especially Safari). Quota limits, transaction behavior, and API quirks may cause cross-browser issues.

**Consequences:**
- Features work inconsistently across browsers
- User data loss on certain browsers
- Development delays for browser-specific fixes

**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Test on all target browsers early (Week 1)
   - Use well-tested abstraction library (e.g., idb)
   - Implement comprehensive error handling
   - Add browser detection and fallbacks

2. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Cross-browser CI/CD testing
   - Browser-specific unit tests
   - Regular compatibility testing
   - Quota management implementation

3. **Contingency Plan:**
   - If Safari issues severe, implement localStorage fallback
   - Document browser-specific limitations
   - Provide clear user warnings

**Timeline:** Mitigate by end of Week 1
**Budget Impact:** +16 hours for cross-browser testing
**Dependencies:** None

**Status Updates:**
- 2025-10-23: Risk identified, mitigation planned
