# Phase 3: Team Collaboration - Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

### Overview
Phase 3 introduces multi-user collaboration features to SQL Studio, enabling teams to share database connections, queries, and collaborate in real-time. This phase builds upon Phase 1 (local-first architecture) and Phase 2 (individual cloud sync) to create a comprehensive Team tier offering.

### Goals and Objectives

**Primary Goals:**
1. Enable organizations to create and manage teams
2. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) with clear permission boundaries
3. Enable shared connections and queries across team members
4. Provide comprehensive audit logging for compliance
5. Create intuitive team management UI

**Success Metrics:**
- 50+ teams created in first month of beta
- <5% support tickets related to permissions confusion
- 100% audit coverage of sensitive operations
- <1s latency for permission checks (p95)
- 95%+ user satisfaction with team features

### Timeline

**Original Allocation:** 4 weeks
**Realistic Estimate:** 6 weeks

**Rationale for Extension:**
- Team collaboration is more complex than originally scoped
- RBAC requires careful security consideration and testing
- Multi-user conflict scenarios need comprehensive testing
- UI/UX for team features requires iteration based on user feedback
- 2-week buffer for unexpected challenges and polish

**Timeline:** Week 13-18 (January 16 - February 27, 2026)

### Team Requirements

**Core Team (Full 6 weeks):**
- 1x Backend Engineer (Go) - Full-time
- 1x Frontend Engineer (React/TypeScript) - Full-time
- 0.5x UI/UX Designer - Part-time (Weeks 1-3, heavy; Weeks 4-6, light)
- 0.5x QA Engineer - Part-time (Weeks 1-2, light; Weeks 3-6, heavy)

**Specialized Support:**
- 0.25x Security Engineer - Weeks 2-3 (RBAC review)
- 0.25x DevOps Engineer - Week 5-6 (deployment)
- Product Manager - All weeks (coordination)

**Total Effort:** ~3.5 FTE over 6 weeks = ~21 person-weeks

### Dependencies

**Phase 1 Dependencies (MUST be complete):**
- ✓ IndexedDB local storage infrastructure
- ✓ Data sanitization layer
- ✓ Multi-tab sync (BroadcastChannel)
- ✓ Tier detection and feature gating

**Phase 2 Dependencies (MUST be complete):**
- ✓ Authentication system (email/OAuth)
- ✓ Turso cloud database with sync
- ✓ JWT token management
- ✓ Conflict resolution (Last-Write-Wins)
- ✓ Payment/subscription system (for tier validation)

**External Dependencies:**
- Turso database capacity (verified: scales to team tier)
- Stripe billing API (team tier product configured)
- Email service (Resend) for team invitations

### Risk Assessment

**High-Priority Risks:**

1. **Permission System Complexity** (Probability: Medium, Impact: High)
   - Risk: RBAC implementation becomes too complex, leading to bugs
   - Mitigation: Start with minimal 3-role system, extensive testing
   - Contingency: Defer advanced permission features to Phase 4

2. **Multi-User Conflict Scenarios** (Probability: High, Impact: Medium)
   - Risk: Edge cases in shared resource editing cause data loss
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive conflict testing, real-time indicators
   - Contingency: Implement pessimistic locking for sensitive operations

3. **UI/UX Complexity** (Probability: Medium, Impact: Medium)
   - Risk: Team management UI becomes confusing for users
   - Mitigation: User testing in Weeks 3-4, iterate based on feedback
   - Contingency: Simplify UI, defer advanced features

4. **Performance Degradation** (Probability: Low, Impact: High)
   - Risk: Permission checks slow down queries significantly
   - Mitigation: Implement caching, index optimization
   - Contingency: Pre-compute permissions, use Redis cache

**See [PHASE_3_RISKS.md](./PHASE_3_RISKS.md) for complete risk register**

### Budget Estimate

**Infrastructure Costs:**
- Turso database (team tier data): $30-50/month additional
- Redis cache (permission caching): $20/month
- Testing environments: $50/month
- **Total:** $100-120/month ongoing

**One-time Costs:**
- Security audit (external): $2,000
- Performance testing tools: $500
- **Total:** $2,500

**Phase 3 Total Budget:** ~$3,000 one-time + $100-120/month ongoing
