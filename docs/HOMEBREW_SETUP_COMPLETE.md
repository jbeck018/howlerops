# Homebrew Tap Setup - Complete Summary

This document provides a complete overview of the Homebrew tap setup for SQL Studio.

## Overview

SQL Studio now has a complete Homebrew tap infrastructure that allows macOS users to install the application with a simple `brew install sql-studio` command. The setup supports both Intel (x86_64) and Apple Silicon (ARM64) architectures with automated formula updates on each release.

## What Has Been Created

### 1. Core Formula

**File**: `/Users/jacob_1/projects/sql-studio/Formula/sql-studio.rb`

A production-ready Homebrew formula that:
- Supports both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs
- Downloads binaries from GitHub releases
- Includes SHA256 checksum verification
- Provides post-installation instructions
- Includes comprehensive test block
- Supports shell completions and man pages (when available)

### 2. Comprehensive Documentation

**File**: `/Users/jacob_1/projects/sql-studio/HOMEBREW.md`

Complete documentation covering:
- User installation instructions
- Maintainer setup guide
- Formula update procedures
- Testing strategies
- Troubleshooting guides
- Security considerations
- Advanced configuration options

### 3. Automated Update Script

**File**: `/Users/jacob_1/projects/sql-studio/scripts/update-homebrew-formula.sh`

A robust Bash script that:
- Fetches latest release from GitHub API
- Downloads release artifacts
- Calculates SHA256 checksums automatically
- Updates formula with new version and URLs
- Commits and pushes to tap repository
- Supports dry-run mode for testing
- Includes comprehensive error handling

### 4. Formula Testing Script

**File**: `/Users/jacob_1/projects/sql-studio/scripts/test-homebrew-formula.sh`

A comprehensive testing script that:
- Validates formula syntax
- Runs Homebrew audit checks
- Tests installation process
- Verifies binary functionality
- Runs formula test block
- Tests cleanup/uninstallation
- Can skip installation tests for quick checks

### 5. GitHub Actions Integration

**File**: `/Users/jacob_1/projects/sql-studio/.github/workflows/release.yml` (updated)

Enhanced release workflow that:
- Builds cross-platform binaries
- Creates GitHub releases
- Automatically updates Homebrew formula
- Runs after release validation
- Uses dedicated GitHub token for tap updates

### 6. Supporting Documentation

Additional files created:

- **Formula/README.md**: README for the tap repository
- **Formula/SETUP_TAP_REPOSITORY.md**: Step-by-step tap setup guide
- **Formula/QUICK_REFERENCE.md**: Quick reference for common operations
- **Formula/.github-workflows-template.yml**: CI workflow template for tap repository

```

## Next Steps

### 1. Create Tap Repository

Create a new repository on GitHub:

```bash
# Repository details
Organization: sql-studio
Name: homebrew-tap
URL: https://github.com/sql-studio/homebrew-tap
Visibility: Public
License: MIT
```

### 2. Initialize Tap Repository

```bash
# Clone the tap repository
git clone https://github.com/sql-studio/homebrew-tap.git
cd homebrew-tap

# Copy files from main repository
mkdir -p Formula
cp /path/to/sql-studio/Formula/sql-studio.rb Formula/
cp /path/to/sql-studio/Formula/README.md .

# Copy GitHub Actions workflow
mkdir -p .github/workflows
cp /path/to/sql-studio/Formula/.github-workflows-template.yml .github/workflows/test.yml

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Initial tap setup"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Configure GitHub Secrets

In the main repository (https://github.com/sql-studio/sql-studio):

1. Go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
2. Add new repository secret:
   - Name: `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN`
   - Value: GitHub Personal Access Token with `repo` scope

To create the token:
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Generate new token (classic)
3. Select `repo` scope
4. Generate and copy the token

### 4. Test the Setup

#### Test Local Formula

```bash
cd /path/to/sql-studio

# Run formula tests
./scripts/test-homebrew-formula.sh Formula/sql-studio.rb

# Test update script in dry-run mode
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token
DRY_RUN=true ./scripts/update-homebrew-formula.sh latest
```

#### Test Automated Updates

```bash
# Create a test release
git tag v2.0.0-test
git push origin v2.0.0-test

# Monitor GitHub Actions
# Visit: https://github.com/sql-studio/sql-studio/actions

# Verify formula updated in tap repository
# Visit: https://github.com/sql-studio/homebrew-tap/commits/main

# Clean up test release
git tag -d v2.0.0-test
git push --delete origin v2.0.0-test
```

#### Test User Installation

```bash
# Tap the repository
brew tap sql-studio/tap

# Install SQL Studio
brew install sql-studio

# Verify installation
sql-studio --version

# Test functionality
brew test sql-studio

# Clean up
brew uninstall sql-studio
brew untap sql-studio/tap
```

### 5. Update Main Repository README

Add Homebrew installation instructions to the main README:

```markdown
## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS)

The easiest way to install SQL Studio on macOS:

```bash
brew install sql-studio/tap/sql-studio
```

To update:

```bash
brew upgrade sql-studio
```

### Manual Installation

Download the latest release for your platform:
- macOS: Download `sql-studio-darwin-amd64.tar.gz` (Intel) or `sql-studio-darwin-arm64.tar.gz` (Apple Silicon)
- Linux: Download `sql-studio-linux-amd64.tar.gz` or `sql-studio-linux-arm64.tar.gz`
- Windows: Download `sql-studio-windows-amd64.tar.gz`
```

### 6. Create First Release

```bash
# Ensure everything is committed
git add .
git commit -m "Add Homebrew tap setup"
git push

# Create a release
git tag v2.0.0
git push origin v2.0.0

# GitHub Actions will:
# 1. Build binaries for all platforms
# 2. Create GitHub release with artifacts
# 3. Update Homebrew formula automatically
```

## How It Works

### User Workflow

1. User runs: `brew install sql-studio/tap/sql-studio`
2. Homebrew downloads the formula from the tap repository
3. Formula determines the user's architecture (Intel or ARM64)
4. Downloads the appropriate binary from GitHub releases
5. Verifies SHA256 checksum
6. Installs binary to Homebrew's bin directory
7. User can run: `sql-studio`

### Release Workflow

1. Developer creates a new release tag (e.g., `v2.0.0`)
2. GitHub Actions workflow triggers
3. Builds binaries for all platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows)
4. Creates GitHub release with all artifacts
5. Validates release artifacts
6. **Automatically updates Homebrew formula**:
   - Fetches release information
   - Downloads artifacts and calculates checksums
   - Updates formula with new version and checksums
   - Commits and pushes to tap repository
7. Users can immediately upgrade: `brew upgrade sql-studio`

### Formula Update Workflow

Automated (via GitHub Actions):
```
New Release → Build Binaries → Upload Assets → Update Formula → Push to Tap
```

Manual (if needed):
```
Run Script → Fetch Release → Calculate Checksums → Update Formula → Push
```

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

1. **Monitor tap repository**:

   - Review automated formula updates
   - Respond to user issues

2. **Update formula structure** (when needed):
   - Add new features (completions, man pages)
   - Update installation steps
   - Enhance test coverage

3. **Rotate GitHub token**:
   - Update `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` before expiration
   - Test automated updates after rotation

### Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions are documented in:
- **HOMEBREW.md**: Comprehensive troubleshooting section
- **QUICK_REFERENCE.md**: Quick fixes for common problems
- **Formula tests**: Run `./scripts/test-homebrew-formula.sh` to diagnose

- [Formula Cookbook](https://docs.brew.sh/Formula-Cookbook)
- [Creating a Tap](https://docs.brew.sh/How-to-Create-and-Maintain-a-Tap)

## Security Considerations

### Token Management

- `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` is stored as a GitHub secret
- Token has `repo` scope only (minimum required)
- Token should be rotated periodically
- Never commit tokens to repository

### Checksum Verification

- All downloads verified with SHA256 checksums
- Checksums calculated automatically
- Mismatches cause installation to fail
- Users can verify manually: `shasum -a 256 binary`

### Code Signing (Future)

Consider adding macOS code signing and notarization:
- Sign binaries with Apple Developer certificate
- Notarize with Apple notarization service
- Update formula to verify signatures
- Enhances user trust and security

## Success Metrics

Track these metrics to measure success:

1. **Installation counts**: Via Homebrew analytics
2. **Formula audit success rate**: All audits pass
3. **Automated update success rate**: 100% target
4. **User issues**: Track installation problems
5. **Architecture distribution**: Intel vs Apple Silicon
