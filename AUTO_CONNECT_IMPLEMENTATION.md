# Auto-Connect Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented automatic reconnection to the last active database connection when the app starts or reloads.

## Features
- Automatically tracks the last active connection ID
- Persists the last connection across app restarts
- Non-blocking background reconnection
- Graceful error handling (fails silently if connection fails)
- Respects the `autoConnectEnabled` setting (default: true)
- Works with secure credential storage (OS keychain)

## Implementation Details

### 1. Connection Store Updates (`/Users/jacob_1/projects/sql-studio/frontend/src/store/connection-store.ts`)

#### Added State Field
```typescript
interface ConnectionState {
  // ...existing fields
  lastActiveConnectionId: string | null // Track last active connection for auto-reconnect
}
```

#### Track Active Connection
When a connection becomes active, we now save its ID:

```typescript
setActiveConnection: (connection) => {
  set({
    activeConnection: connection,
    lastActiveConnectionId: connection?.id ?? null
  })
}

// Also tracked in connectToDatabase when successful
set({
  connections: /* ... */,
  activeConnection: updatedConnection,
  lastActiveConnectionId: connectionId,
})
```

#### Persist to Storage
```typescript
partialize: (state) => ({
  connections: /* ... */,
  lastActiveConnectionId: state.lastActiveConnectionId, // Persisted
  autoConnectEnabled: state.autoConnectEnabled,
  activeEnvironmentFilter: state.activeEnvironmentFilter,
})
```

#### Initialization Function
```typescript
export async function initializeConnectionStore() {
  const state = useConnectionStore.getState()

  // Check if auto-connect is enabled
  if (!state.autoConnectEnabled) {
    console.debug('Auto-connect is disabled')
    return
  }

  // Get last active connection
  const lastConnectionId = state.lastActiveConnectionId
  if (!lastConnectionId) {
    console.debug('No last active connection found')
    return
  }

  // Find the connection
  const connection = state.connections.find(c => c.id === lastConnectionId)
  if (!connection) {
    console.debug('Last active connection no longer exists:', lastConnectionId)
    return
  }

  // Check if already connected (safety check)
  if (connection.isConnected) {
    console.debug('Connection already active:', connection.name)
    return
  }

  // Auto-connect in background
  console.debug('Auto-connecting to:', connection.name)
  try {
    await state.connectToDatabase(lastConnectionId)
    console.debug('Auto-connect successful:', connection.name)
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn('Auto-connect failed:', connection.name, error)
    // Fail silently - don't block app startup
  }
}
```

### 2. App Initialization (`/Users/jacob_1/projects/sql-studio/frontend/src/app.tsx`)

Added auto-connect to the app startup sequence:

```typescript
import { initializeConnectionStore } from './store/connection-store'

function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    // ...existing initialization code

    // Auto-connect to last active connection
    // Add small delay to ensure store hydration is complete
    const autoConnectTimer = setTimeout(() => {
      initializeConnectionStore().catch(err => {
        console.error('Auto-connect failed:', err)
        // App continues normally even if auto-connect fails
      })
    }, 100)

    return () => clearTimeout(autoConnectTimer)
  }, [])

  // ...rest of app
}
```

## Behavior

### First-Time Usage
1. User creates connections
2. User connects to a database
3. Connection ID is saved as `lastActiveConnectionId`
4. User closes/reloads app

### On Reload
1. App starts and hydrates connection store
2. After 100ms delay, `initializeConnectionStore()` is called
3. Function checks:
   - Is `autoConnectEnabled` true? (default: yes)
   - Is there a `lastActiveConnectionId`?
   - Does the connection still exist?
   - Is it not already connected?
4. If all checks pass, automatically connects in background
5. User sees their connection active without manual intervention

### Error Handling
- If connection fails (invalid credentials, server down, etc.):
  - Error is logged to console as warning
  - App continues to function normally
  - User can manually reconnect or choose different connection

### Disabling Auto-Connect
Users can disable auto-connect by setting:
```typescript
useConnectionStore.getState().setAutoConnect(false)
```

This setting is persisted and respected on future app startups.

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Users don't need to manually reconnect every time they reload
2. **Workflow Continuity**: Maintains context between sessions
3. **Non-intrusive**: Runs in background, doesn't block app startup
4. **Safe**: Handles errors gracefully, no crashes if connection fails
5. **Respects Preferences**: Can be disabled if user prefers manual connections

## Security Considerations

- No credentials are stored in `lastActiveConnectionId` (only the ID)
- Actual passwords retrieved from secure OS keychain
- Connection state cleaned on rehydration (no stale session IDs)
- Works seamlessly with existing credential migration system

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create a connection and connect to it
- [ ] Reload the app
- [ ] Verify the connection automatically reconnects
- [ ] Test with invalid credentials (should fail gracefully)
- [ ] Test with server down (should fail gracefully)
- [ ] Test with `autoConnectEnabled: false` (should not auto-connect)
- [ ] Test with deleted connection (should skip auto-connect)
- [ ] Test with no prior connections (should do nothing)
- [ ] Verify console logs show appropriate debug messages
