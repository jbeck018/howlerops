# Howlerops Backend - Continuous Integration Workflow
# =============================================================================
# This workflow provides fast feedback for developers by running tests and
# linting on every pull request and push to main branch. It's optimized for
# speed with parallel jobs and aggressive caching.
#
# Triggers:
# - Pull requests targeting main branch
# - Direct pushes to main branch
# - Manual workflow dispatch
#
# Jobs:
# 1. test: Runs unit and integration tests with coverage
# 2. lint: Runs golangci-lint for code quality checks
# 3. build: Verifies the application compiles successfully
#
# Success Criteria:
# - All tests pass with no race conditions
# - Code meets linting standards
# - Application builds without errors
# =============================================================================

# =============================================================================
# Workflow Summary
# =============================================================================
# This CI workflow runs on every PR and push to main, providing:
#
# 1. Fast Feedback (3-5 minutes typical runtime)
#    - Parallel job execution
#    - Aggressive caching of dependencies
#    - Incremental linting (only new issues)
#
# 2. Comprehensive Testing
#    - Unit and integration tests
#    - Race condition detection
#    - Coverage reporting with thresholds
#
# 3. Code Quality
#    - Linting with golangci-lint (20+ linters)
#    - Security scanning with gosec
#    - Formatting verification
#
# 4. Build Verification
#    - Multi-platform compilation checks
#    - Version embedding verification
#
# 5. Security
#    - Dependency vulnerability scanning
#    - CVE detection in Go modules
#
# To customize:
# - Adjust coverage threshold in test job (currently 60%)
# - Add/remove platforms in build matrix
# - Configure linters in backend-go/.golangci.yml
# - Set CODECOV_TOKEN secret for private repos
# =============================================================================
